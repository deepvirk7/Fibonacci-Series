# Fibonacci Series<br><br>

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.<br><br>
Mathematically, it's defined as:<br>
F(0) = 0<br>
F(1) = 1<br>
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1<br><br>

So the series begins:<br>
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
